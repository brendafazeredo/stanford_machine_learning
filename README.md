<h1>Stanford - Machine Learning course projects</h1>

<p>This repository showcases a collection of my Machine Learning projects completed during my tenure at Stanford University.</p>

<p>In these projects, I have delved deep into the world of predictive modeling, honing my skills in data analysis, feature engineering, and model evaluation. You'll find implementations of key algorithms, including decision trees, support vector machines, and ensemble methods, with a primary focus on solving real-world problems through supervised learning.</p>

<p>The Regression projects demonstrate my ability to model and predict continuous variables, with a keen eye on data preprocessing, model optimization, and performance assessment. In the Classification projects, I have tackled the challenge of categorizing data into distinct classes, essential in applications like image recognition, spam detection, and more.</p>

<p>It is a testament to my dedication to mastering machine learning techniques and my commitment to sharing knowledge with the wider community. I encourage collaboration, feedback, and further exploration of these projects. Join me in the exciting journey of data-driven discovery and innovation in the field of machine learning</p>
